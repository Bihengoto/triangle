## Description

At the level at which I have designed this program, it enables the user to have an interactive interface. The interface has three fields from which the user fills numbers that the program will evaluate to determine whether it is an isosceles triangle, equilateral triangle, scalene triangle and not a triangle.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- A web browser
- The web browser should support HTML5 and CSS
- its simple to use and interactive GUI
- easy to navigate through
- JavaScript support
