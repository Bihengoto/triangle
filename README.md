# Triangle Tracker

#### The web application takes three inputs from the user and from the values it determines the type of the Triangle, 2019

#### By **Isaac Bihengoto**

## Description

At the level at which I have designed this program, it enables the user to have an interactive interface. The interface has three fields from which the user fills numbers that the program will evaluate to determine whether it is an isosceles triangle, equilateral triangle, scalene triangle and not a triangle.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- A web browser
- The web browser should support HTML5 and CSS
- its simple to use and interactive GUI
- easy to navigate through
- JavaScript support
- a PC of 500mb Ram and 20gb HDD connected to the internet
